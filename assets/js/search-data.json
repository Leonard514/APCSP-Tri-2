Here are the criteria: | No need to create a graphical user interface (output the course in graphical form); that would be too demanding.

You must randomize the following: . Initial direction of the robot (up, down, left, right) | Initial Position of the robot | Goal position | Positions of at least 12 wall/obstacle squares | The latter three must be mutually exclusive (on different squares). This prevents you from generating a course where the robot is on the goal, on a wall square, or the goal is in a wall square .

            "content": "Syntax . In collegeboard psudo-code RANDOM(a, b) is used to generate a random integer value in the range from a to b. For example if RANDOM(1, 5) is written 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have the same chance to show up. In Python the random library can be imported and the min and max ranges can be set to any integer. . import random ## The random library must be imported to use it&#39;s functions ## Either randint or randrange can be used the only difference is that you can use a step function in randrange and the max value won&#39;t be inclued x = 0 a = 0 b = 100 while x &lt; 10: print (&#39;--&#39;) x = x + 1 i = random.randint(a, b) r = random.randrange(a, b, 10) print(i, r) . -- 93 0 -- 0 70 -- 72 70 -- 60 20 -- 67 50 -- 35 90 -- 46 10 -- 10 30 -- 37 80 -- 16 90 . randint . A general way to to write this is randint(start, stop) where start is the minimum value, stop is the maximum value. And this allows you to generate a random integer from a set range and this can help you create code for things like a coin-flip, dice roll, and anything else which needs an inclusive range. . numRolls = 10 x = 0 while x &lt; numRolls: x = x + 1 i = random.randint(1, 6) print(i) . 1 4 1 5 2 2 6 6 5 3 . randrange . In general randrange can be written like randrange(start, stop, step) where start is the minimum value, stop is the maximum value (like the randint function), and step is the incriment the values can be and its default value is 1. If start = 0 and step = 5 all the values that can by outputed are 0 and multiples of 5. And if start = 2 and step = 3 the output would be 2 and a multiple of 3 plus 2. . x = 0 while x &lt; 10: x = x + 1 r = random.randrange(2, 30, 3) print(r) . 5 29 14 17 23 2 29 8 17 29 .

RANDOM(1, 100) &lt;= 75 | RANDOM(1, 100) &lt; 75 | RANDOM(1, 4) &lt; 3 | RANDOM(1, 4) &lt;= 3 | Answer 1 and 4 are both correct, 1 includes the values from 1-75 which means that it has a 75% chance to be chosen and 4 includes the values of 1, 2, and 3 which makes 3/4 which is the same as a 75% chance. There is a 3x3 grid which randomly generates a point based on the following code: . row ← RANDOM(1, 3) column ← RANDOM(1, 2) POINT(row, column) What are the possible locations a point can be?

Python and API resource definitions are used for RESTful API definitions. Abstraction of Frontend and Backend code, the exchange of standard data format (JSON), and guidelines for exchange (REST) is a technique that saves a lot of time between developers. Learning APIs is a highly recommended step for every developer trying to break into the world of tech. . Covid19: RapidAPI example. This is introducing APIs by accessing something that already exists. RapidAPI shows how many practice RESTful definitions. Almost any data source imagined can be accessed here. | Jokes: An introduction to Python RESTful API libraries. A Python List is used to make a Data Model, but persistence in this technique is limited, each time server is refreshed data is lost. This example is great for learning, but data is considered volatile. | Users: Another RESTful API library example. However, this backend establishes data persistence through the use of a database. This data if properly managed in deployment and migrated when changed can last forever. | . Web API Overview . . A Web API is an application programming interface typically for a web browser. Non-changing or Static Endpoints are used in interacting with the server-side Web APIs. RESTful Web APIs use HTTP methods to access resources via URL parameters, and use JSON for transmitting text between client and server. Server. In these examples, we will be using Python to define REST APIs. Python tools are very popular for building RESTful APIs | REST: Representational State Transfer. A set of guidelines on how to architect a network-connected software system. | Client-server: One guideline is a client and server must be decoupled from each other, allowing each to develop independently. | Layered system: The client may access the resources on the server indirectly through other layers such as a proxy or using authentication. This will be clarified by application and security requirements. | . Client. JavaScript is the frontend language used to consume data from the Python defined REST APIs. Fetch will be used to make HTTP requests, as well as handle HTTP response. There are four basic HTTP methods, they align with Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). | GET =&gt; Retrieve/Read data | POST =&gt; Create data | PUT =&gt; Update data | DELETE =&gt; Delete data | . REST endpoints will have similarity from application to application. In planning APIs, for a Users system you can anticipate key methods.

Once a RESTful API receives and processes an HTTP request, it will return an HTTP response. Included in this response is an HTTP status code. Common status codes are shown. | 200 =&gt; OK, this response will then have the promise of JSON data | 400 =&gt; Bad Request | 404 =&gt; Not Found | 500 =&gt; Internal Server Error (aka bug) | . . . .",
