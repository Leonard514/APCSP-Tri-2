    "1. Create a program to simulate a dice game where each player rolls two fair dice; the player with the greater sum wins\n",

    "- No need to create a graphical user interface (output the course in graphical form); that would be too demanding. You can use store your randomizations in variables to be printed, after which you can sketch one instance of your output using any means (handdrawn, google drawings, etc.) to attach to your submission as an image.\n",

    "You must randomize the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial direction of the robot (up, down, left, right)\n",
    "1. Initial Position of the robot\n",
    "1. Goal position\n",
    "1. Positions of at least 12 wall/obstacle squares\n",

    "Extra credit opportunity: Put safeguards in your program to make sure the robot course is actually possible to complete. This one is tough, so if you manage to do it you're pretty much guaranteed to get 1.0 points. This will not likely be the only way to get a perfect score, however."
