- **Bits:** A bit or a binary digit, is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store. A bit can be one of 2 physical states, such as either 0 or 1, yes or no, and true or false. 

- **Bytes:** A byte is a unit of data that is eight bits long. It is used by computers to represent a character such as a letter or number symbol.

- **Hexadecimal:** Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. There are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters -- A, B, C, D, E and F. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits.

- **Unsigned Integer:** Numbers without + or - sign, only representing the magnitude not the direction. Used when we know that the value we are storing will always be non-negative
   - ex: 1, 2, 3, 4

- **Signed Integer:** The default where the variable can hold positive or negative numbers
   - ex: -1, 6, -29, 1000

- **Comparison Operators**
   - Operators used in programming languages which compare two different values. These can often be used to set up statements which return a boolean value (true/false), which can be stored in variables. All examples below are in (Python)[https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html] and were checked using the bool() command, which returns the True/False output.
| Operator | Function | True output example | False output example | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| == | Checks if two values are equal to each other | “Hrar” == “Hrar” ; 1 == 1.0 | “Hrar” == “hrar” ; 1 == 2 | If strings are compared, this is case-sensitive. Follows numerical equivalence if a float and integer is used. Cannot use leading zeros for integers/floats. |
| != | Checks if two values are not equal to each other | “Hrar” != “hrar” ; 1 != 2 | “Hrar” != “Hrar” ; 1 != 1.0 | Similar to above |
| < | Checks if the left value is less than the right value | 1 < 2 ; “zz” < “hi” | 2 < 1 ; “az” < “hi” ; 2 < 2 | If strings are compared, the string appearing last in alphabetical order is considered less. **float(‘NaN’)** and **decimal.Decimal(‘NaN’)** will yield false regardless of what they are compared to. |
| > | Checks if the left value is greater than the right value | 2 > 1 ; “az” > “hi” | 1 > 2 ; “zz” > “hi” ; 2 > 2 | Similar to above |
| <= | Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value | 1 <= 2 ; “zz” <= ; “hi” ; 2 <= 2 | 2 <= 1 ; “az” <= “hi” | Similar to above |
| >= | Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value | 2 >= 1 ; “az” >= “hi” ; 2 >= 2 | 1 >= 2 ; “zz” >= “hi” | Similar to above |
| in/not in | Checks if the specified value is an element in the specified list. in returns true if the element is in the list; not in returns true if the element is not in the list. Example: List = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, “hi”] | 1 in List ; 3 in List ; 5 in List ; “hi” in List ; “What” not in List ; “Why” not in List | 2 in List ; 4 in List ; 6 in List ; 9 not in List ; 7 not in List ; “Weird” in List | As usual, strings are case-sensitive. May be useful for conditional statements. |

- **Boolean Expressions and Selection**
   - The value of a boolean variable (True/False) can be used as conditions in selection (often known as if statements). The condition of the if statement is the boolean variable; if its value is True, the condition passes. A possible function of this is in Python code below

```python
# Assume the grade was calculated by a computer program
# The bool command is here to make a boolean variable
# In a larger computer program, the value was likely
# generated by previous commands

Grade = 89.49
isA = bool(Grade >= 90)

if isA:
	print(“Yay!”)
else:
	print(“hmm”)
```

Output: hmm

- **Booleans Expressions and Iteration**
    - Certain forms of iteration (specifically while loops in Python) can use a boolean variable as a condition (similar to selection commands). As you may expect, the while loop executes commands until the value of the variable is false. In terms of a computer program, this could perhaps be used to execute commands critical for maintaining a certain process until that process is no longer needed. This could also potentially be used to periodically send notifications until a certain condition is met (ex: an assignment is submitted). Here’s some informal python code:

```python
num = 10
correct = bool(num > 0)

while correct:
	print(num)
	num = num - 1
	correct = bool(num > 0)
```

output: 
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1

- **Truth Tables:**  A table for a logical operator (ex: AND, OR, XOR) containing each variable and all possible input and output results of that operator.

AND TABLE: All inputs must be true to return output of true.

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
|-|-|-|
| False | False | False |
| False | True | False |
| True | False | False |
| True | True | True |

OR TABLE: At least one input must be true to return output of true.

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
|-|-|-|
| False | False | False |
| False | True | True |
| True | False | True |
| True | True | True |

XOR TABLE: Exactly one input must be true to return output of true.

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
|-|-|-|
| False | False | False |
| False | True | True |
| True | False | True |
| True | True | False |

- **Characters**
   - The units which make up a string. These can be letters, numbers, special symbols (!@#$%^&*), or even spaces. Regardless, if one types, each keystroke outputs one character.
   - Ex: “keyboard hi!!!” has 14 characters: 10 letters, three exclamation marks, and a space.
- **Strings**
   - A variable data type which consists of a combination of letters, numbers, and other special characters (ex: @#$%^&*). They are seen inside quotation marks, and operators cannot affect any numbers in the string.
```python
stringVar = "Hello World!"
```
   - "Hello World!" is a string

- **Length**
   - The number of elements in a list. Here’s an example in Python:
```python
numList = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1]
```
   - This list has a length of 17 because it has 17 elements. Each element is separated by a comma.

- **Concatenation**: the act of joining two strings into a single string. Often, these strings are printed to an output terminal/console. Here’s an example in pseudocode:

```
concat(“tri”, “llion”)
```
   - This concatenates the strings “tri” and “llion”, making a new string “trillion”.

- **Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings**
   - The first two (upper and lower) seem to be referring to Python methods. They are quite simple. I think it would be easiest to explain with a demonstration:

```python
String = “WhYaReWeDoInGtHiS”

print(string)
print(string.upper())
print(string.lower())
```
Output:
WhYaReWeDoInGtHiS
WHYAREWEDOINGTHIS
whyarewedoingthis


Relatively intuitive. The upper() method changes all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase, while the lower() method does the opposite. A potential reason for this would be ensuring uniform case (especially of uppercase when making important headings like page/screen titles)

   - Traversing strings behaves highly similar to iterating elements in a list, except that instead of iterating through a list, it’s a string. Elements in a list are now the characters of a string. A potential application of this could be to search all strings for a specific substring. Here’s some example python code:

```python
#Very informative example here: 
#https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterate-over-characters-of-a-string-in-python/

String = “Thirty Trillion Dollars”

for i in String:
	if i == “T”
	print(“T detected!”)
```
Output:
T detected!
T detected!

- **Python If, Elif, Else conditionals**
   - Python if statements execute associated lines of code if the **if condition** is satisfied.
   - If the **if condition** is not satisfied, an Elif statement is executed as fallback… with another condition and associated commands.
   - If all associated **Elif conditions** are not satisfied, there can be an else statement which unconditionally executes associated commands.
```python
input = input(“enter a string”)
if input == “Hi”:
print(“Hello World!”)
print(“How are you doing today?”)
elif input == “Why”:
print(“That’s a good question to ask about everything that happens.”)
elif input == “Who are you”:
print(“I’m an anonymous guest. Pleased to meet you.”)
else:
print(“Have a great day!”)
```
   - This code uses if statements and elif statements to return strings for three special inputs (“Hi,” “Why,” “Who are you”). If the input were any of those strings, the associated command would be executed. Otherwise, the command associated with the else statement (which prints “Have a great day!”) would be executed.
