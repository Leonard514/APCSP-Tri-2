- **Comparison Operators**
   - Operators used in programming languages which compare two different values. These can often be used to set up statements which return a boolean value (true/false), which can be stored in variables. All examples below are in (Python)[https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html] and were checked using the bool() command, which returns the True/False output.
| Operator | Function | True output example | False output example | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| == | Checks if two values are equal to each other | “Hrar” == “Hrar”
1 == 1.0 | “Hrar” == “hrar”
1 == 2 | If strings are compared, this is case-sensitive. Follows numerical equivalence if a float and integer is used. Cannot use leading zeros for integers/floats. |
